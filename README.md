# stellar-wallet-test
Run the project from the stellar root folder.
cd stellar
python3 manage.py runserver


Move money and access new markets.
Intended to enhance rather than undermine or replace the existing financial system.

A valid keypair does not make an account: in order to prevent unused accounts from bloating the ledger, Stellar requires accounts to hold a minimum balance of 1 XLM before they actually exist. Until it gets a bit of funding, your keypair doesnâ€™t warrant space on the ledger.

Current Status

Functionality available for users to create and activate a wallet in the stellar network.
