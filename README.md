Why Stellar Network?

Move money and access new markets.
Intended to enhance rather than undermine or replace the existing financial system.

How to create an account?

A valid keypair does not make an account: in order to prevent unused accounts from bloating the ledger, Stellar requires accounts to hold a minimum balance of 1 XLM before they actually exist. Until it gets a bit of funding, your keypair doesnâ€™t warrant space on the ledger.
